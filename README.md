## Introduction

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of flight activity and customer loyalty history. The objective is to explore and understand patterns in flight data and how they relate to different customer variables.
  
## Files

Files required for project review:

*    Customer Flight Activity.csv: Contains data on customer flight activity.
*    Customer Loyalty History.csv: provides a detailed profile of customers as well as includes data on the customer loyalty program.
*    airline_data.ipynb: Jupyter notebook including exploratory data analysis (EDA).



## Requirements

1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. seaborn
5. scikit-learn

If you do not have these libraries, you can install them using *pip install*
